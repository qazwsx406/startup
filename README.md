# HotTakes

[My Notes](notes.md)

"Hot Takes" is a social polling application designed for sharing and reacting to controversial opinions with straightforward, punchy engagement. Users can effortlessly post their own provocative statements, which are then presented to the community for a quick verdict. Each hot take features two distinct interaction buttons: "Bet" for agreement and "Ain't no way" for disagreement, dynamically enhanced with a random, sentiment-appropriate GIF to visually amplify the user's choice. Vote counts update in real-time, offering instant feedback on the community's collective stance, making "Hot Takes" an efficient and entertaining platform for lively, opinion-driven interaction

### Key features

- Hot Take Submission: Users can easily submit their own controversial opinions via a dedicated input area on the home page.
- Opinion Polling: Each hot take features two clear interaction buttonsâ€”"Bet" (to agree) and "Ain't no way" (to disagree)â€”for users to cast their vote.
- Real-time Vote Counts: Numerical tallies for both "Bet" and "Ain't no way" are displayed immediately, showing the current community sentiment.
- User Identification: Every hot take is attributed to a specific username and includes a timestamp to indicate when it was posted.
- Personal "My Takes" Feed: A dedicated section allows users to view and track all the hot takes they have personally submitted.
- User Authentication: A 'Log Out' option signifies a user account system for personalized and secure access to the application.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Structures the application with two main pages: a dedicated login page and the primary voting page.
- **CSS** - Styles the application for a responsive, visually appealing, and accessible user interface.
- **React** - Builds the interactive frontend, managing both the separate login page and the voting interface. It displays hot takes, handles votes, and updates vote counts in real-time.
- **Service** - Provides API endpoints for user login, submitting new hot takes, retrieving existing hot takes, submitting user votes, and getting vote tallies
- **DB/Login** - Stores all application data (users, takes, votes) and manages secure user login; viewing, posting and voting hot takes requires authentication.
- **WebSocket** - Ensures real-time updates of vote counts across all active users.
